\subsection{Foundations}
\DEF{Lie algebra,lie-algebra}
A vector space $\g g$ over a field $\bb{K}$ with the Lie bracket satisfying the conditions
\begin{enumerate}
\item Lie bracket is bilinear
\item $\forall x \in \g g,\ [x,x] = 0$
\item $\forall x, y, z \in \g g,\ [[x,y],z]+[[y,z],x]+[[z,x],y] = 0$
\end{enumerate}
is called a \EMPH{Lie algebra} over $\bb{K}$.

\DEF{General linear Lie algebra,general-linear-lie-algebra}
$\g{gl}_n(\bb{R})$ is the Lie algebra $M_n(\bb{R})$ with the Lie bracket $[x,y] = xy - yx$.

\DEF{Derivation algebra,derivation-algebra}
A linear endomorphism $D$ of an algebra $\bb{A}$ over $\bb{R}$ satisfying $D(xy) = D(x)y + xD(y)$ is called a \EMPH{derivation} of $\bb{A}$. The set of all derivations $\mathrm{Der}\, \bb{A}$ with the addition, scaler multiplication, and lie bracket defined as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $(D+D')(x) = D(x)+D'(x)$
\item $(\alpha D)(x) = \alpha D(x)$
\item $[D,D'](x) = D(D'(x)) - D'(D(x))$
\end{enumerate}
is a Lie algebra called the \EMPH{derivation algebra} of $\bb{A}$.

\DEF{Lie subalgebra,lie-subalgebra}
A linear subspace $\g h \subset \g g$ of a Lie algebra $\g g$ is a \EMPH{Lie subalgebra} of $\g g$ if $\forall x, y \in \g h$, $[x,y] \in \g h$.

For linear subspaces $\g a, \g b \subset \g g$, $[\g a, \g b]$ denotes the subspace generated by $[x,y]$ with $x \in \g a, y \in \g b$.

\DPROP{Special linear Lie algebra,special-linear-lie-algebra}
$\sl_n(\bb{R}) = \{ x \in \gl_n(\bb{R}) \mid \tr x = 0 \} $ is a Lie subalgebra of $\gl_n(\bb{R})$.

\DPROP{Orthogonal Lie algebra,orthogonal-lie-algebra}
$\o(n) = \{ x \in \gl_n(\bb{R}) \mid {}^t\!x = -x \}$ is a Lie subalgebra of $\sl_n(\bb{R})$.

\DPROP{Ideal of a Lie algebra,ideal-of-a-lie-algebra}
A linear subspace $\g h \subset \g g$ of a Lie algebra $\g g$ is an \EMPH{ideal} of $\g g$ if $\forall x \in \g g, y \in \g h,\ [x,y] \in \g h$.

For ideals $\g a, \g b \subset \g g$, $[\g a, \g b]$ is also an ideal.

\DEF{Derived ideal of a Lie algebra,derived-ideal-of-a-lie-algebra}
For a Lie algebra $\g g$, $D\g g = [\g g, \g g]$ is an ideal of $\g g$ called the \EMPH{derived ideal} of $\g g$.

If $\g g = \gl_n(\bb{R})$, $D\g g = \sl_n(\bb{R})$.

\DPROP{Homomorphism of Lie algebras,homomorphism-of-lie-algebras}
For Lie algebras $\g g, \g h$, a linear map $\varphi \colon \g g \to \g h$ is called a \EMPH{homomorphism} if $\forall x, y \in \g g,\ \varphi([x,y]) = [\varphi(x), \varphi(y)]$. A homomorphism $\varphi$ is an \EMPH{isomorphism} if it is bijective. Lie algebras between which there exists an isomorphism are said to be \EMPH{isomorphic} to each other, written $\g g \cong \g h$.

A composite of homomorphisms is also a homomorphism, and that of isomorphisms is also an isomorphism.

The kernel $\ker \varphi = \{ x \in \g g \mid \varphi(x) = 0 \}$ of a homomorphism $\varphi$ is an ideal of $\g g$ while the image $\im \varphi = \varphi(\g g)$ of $\varphi$ is a Lie subalgebra of $\g h$.

\DEF{Representation of a Lie algebra on a vector space,representation-of-a-lie-algebra-on-a-vector-space}
For a Lie algebra $\g g$ and a vector space $V$, a homomorphism $\rho \colon \g g \to \g{gl}(V)$ is called a \EMPH{representation} of $\g g$ on $V$.

\DPROP{Adjoint representation of a Lie algebra,adjoint-representation-of-a-lie-algebra}
For a Lie algebra $\g g$ and $x \in \g g$, define a derivation $\ad (x) \colon \g g \to \g g$ by $\ad(x)(y) = [x,y]$. A representation $\ad \colon \g g \ni x \mapsto \ad(x) \in \gl (\g g)$ is called the \EMPH{adjoint representation} of $\g g$. The \EMPH{center} of $\g g$ is $\g z = \ker(\ad)$, which is a commutative ideal. $\im(\ad)$ is an ideal of $\der \g g$. A derivation $\ad(x)$ is called a \EMPH{inner derivation} of $\g g$.

\DEF{Quotient algebra for Lie algebras,quotient-algebra-for-lie-algebras}
For a Lie algebra $\g g$ and an ideal $\g a \subset \g g$, the \EMPH{quotient algebra} is
\[
\g g / \g a = \{ \BAR x = x + \g a \mid x \in \g g \}
\]
with canonical operations, where $\BAR x = \{ y \in \g g \mid x \equiv y \pmod{\g a} \} = \{ x + a \mid a \in \g a \}$ called the \EMPH{class} of $x$. The homomorphism $\varphi \colon \g g \ni x \mapsto \BAR x \in \g g / \g a$ is called the \EMPH{canonical homomorphism}.

\THM{The first isomorphism theorem for Lie algebras,the-first-isomorphism-theorem-for-lie-algebras}

\[
C^0 \g g = \g g,\quad C^k \g g = [\g g, C^{k-1}\g g],\quad k = 1, 2, \dotsc
\]
$\g g$ is said to be \EMPH{nilpotent} if $C^s \g g = \{ 0 \}$ for some $s$ called the \EMPH{length} of $\g g$.
